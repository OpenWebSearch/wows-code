The sombre tally reflects the continued risks of doing journalism and reaffirms journalist safety as a global challenge.  IPI calls on authorities to end impunity for these crimes and to ensure the protection of journalists, who must be able to do their work freely and safely.\\n  Today, the IPI global network published its yearly Death Watch.  IPI’s research shows that since the beginning of 2021, a total of 45 journalists were killed in connection with their work, or lost their lives on assignment.  Of these 45 journalists, 40 were male and five were female.  A total of 28 were targeted due to their work, while three were killed while covering conflict, two lost their lives covering civil unrest, and one journalist was killed while on assignment.   \n",

All seven cases were targeted killings.  According to IPI’s analysis, journalists researching local politics and organized crime, including drug trafficking, are especially at risk.  Most of the targeted journalists were examining these or related topics.\\n  Another explanation for the high number of killed journalists is the level of impunity.  According to ARTICLE 19 Mexico, in only one of these seven cases have suspects have been arrested.  The continued high number of killings confirms Mexico’s status as one of the deadliest countries for journalists to work.  Despite this tragic status quo, the government there has decided to stop funds allocated for upholding the Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists (LPPDHP).\\n  After Mexico, Afghanistan and India are the two next-deadliest countries, with six killings each.  In Afghanistan, most killings occurred in relation to the violent conflict as a result of the Taliban’s takeover of the country this summer.   \n",

For example, high-risk crime journalist Peter R. De Vries was shot on an Amsterdam city street in broad daylight on July 6, 2021, despite the fact that the Netherlands is considered one of the countries with the highest degree of press freedom in the world.  The De Vries case is currently classified as Under Investigation on IPI’s Death Watch.  In Greece, crime reporter Giorgos Karaivaz was shot outside his home in Athens.  As of December 2021, no suspects have been publicly identified and no arrests have been made, while public information about the status of the investigation remains scarce.\\nImpunity\\nIPI’s analysis shows an alarmingly insufficient response from authorities to the killings, leading to high levels of impunity for crimes against journalists.  In only six of the 28 cases have local police reportedly arrested suspects.   \n",

There may be an outer ring of brighter redness with or without a central area of clearing, leading to a \"bulls-eye\" appearance.  This classic initial rash is called \"erythema migrans\" (formerly called erythema chronicum migrans).  Patients often can't recall the tick bite (the ticks can be as small as the periods in this paragraph).  Also, they may not have the identifying rash to signal the doctor.  The rash may or may not itch.  More than one in four patients never even develop a rash.  The redness of the skin is often accompanied by generalized fatigue, muscle and joint pain and stiffness, swollen lymph nodes (\"swollen glands\"), headache, and less often fever, resembling symptoms of a viral infection.\\n  The redness resolves, without treatment, in about a month.   \n",

Lyme disease is most often transmitted by black-legged tick bites and in recent studies has also been found in mosquitos.  The Lyme literate medical team at Sponaugle Wellness Institute have also concluded it can be sexually transmitted or passed on to an unborn child.\\n  Black-legged ticks, also known as deer ticks, are most prevalent in the Northeast United States but have been found in all 50 states and Canada.  These ticks live in wooded and grassy areas.  Cases of Lyme disease are on the rise in recent years showing reported cases nearly doubling since 2014.  The CDC estimates cases in the United States at more than 300,000 people infected annually while acknowledging that Lyme disease can be difficult to diagnose.\\n  Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, is a corkscrew or helix-shaped organism called a spirochete.  These spirochetes are known for being serious pathogens with Lyme disease’s cellular make-up being close to that of syphilis.   \n",

As discussed above, many suffer notice a bulls-eye like rash called “erythema migrans” which is a sign of the bacteria multiplying in the bloodstream.  If the Lyme disease is left untreated, Lyme patients may experience a wide range of physical and neurological symptoms including, loss of memory or concentration, depression, speech problems, pain and swelling, cough, facial palsy or muscle loss and more.\\n  Lyme disease can be broken down into 3 stages.\\n  Stage 1 (Detection)\\nOften called the “early localized” stage of lyme disease, symptoms start a few days to a few weeks after contraction.  The symptoms of stage 1 lyme disease mimic those of the flu making them difficult to link to a bite, especially if the sufferer does not remember being bitten.\\n   \n",

During a blood test, blood is usually drawn from a vein in the arm and tested for the antibodies a person’s body produces in response to the invading Borrelia burgdorferi.

The sombre tally reflects the continued risks of doing journalism and reaffirms journalist safety as a global challenge.  IPI calls on authorities to end impunity for these crimes and to ensure the protection of journalists, who must be able to do their work freely and safely.\\n  Today, the IPI global network published its yearly Death Watch.  IPI’s research shows that since the beginning of 2021, a total of 45 journalists were killed in connection with their work, or lost their lives on assignment.  Of these 45 journalists, 40 were male and five were female.  A total of 28 were targeted due to their work, while three were killed while covering conflict, two lost their lives covering civil unrest, and one journalist was killed while on assignment.</td>\n",

All seven cases were targeted killings.  According to IPI’s analysis, journalists researching local politics and organized crime, including drug trafficking, are especially at risk.  Most of the targeted journalists were examining these or related topics.\\n  Another explanation for the high number of killed journalists is the level of impunity.  According to ARTICLE 19 Mexico, in only one of these seven cases have suspects have been arrested.  The continued high number of killings confirms Mexico’s status as one of the deadliest countries for journalists to work.  Despite this tragic status quo, the government there has decided to stop funds allocated for upholding the Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists (LPPDHP).\\n  After Mexico, Afghanistan and India are the two next-deadliest countries, with six killings each.  In Afghanistan, most killings occurred in relation to the violent conflict as a result of the Taliban’s takeover of the country this summer.</td>\n",

For example, high-risk crime journalist Peter R. De Vries was shot on an Amsterdam city street in broad daylight on July 6, 2021, despite the fact that the Netherlands is considered one of the countries with the highest degree of press freedom in the world.  The De Vries case is currently classified as Under Investigation on IPI’s Death Watch.  In Greece, crime reporter Giorgos Karaivaz was shot outside his home in Athens.  As of December 2021, no suspects have been publicly identified and no arrests have been made, while public information about the status of the investigation remains scarce.\\nImpunity\\nIPI’s analysis shows an alarmingly insufficient response from authorities to the killings, leading to high levels of impunity for crimes against journalists.  In only six of the 28 cases have local police reportedly arrested suspects.</td>\n",

There may be an outer ring of brighter redness with or without a central area of clearing, leading to a \"bulls-eye\" appearance.  This classic initial rash is called \"erythema migrans\" (formerly called erythema chronicum migrans).  Patients often can't recall the tick bite (the ticks can be as small as the periods in this paragraph).  Also, they may not have the identifying rash to signal the doctor.  The rash may or may not itch.  More than one in four patients never even develop a rash.  The redness of the skin is often accompanied by generalized fatigue, muscle and joint pain and stiffness, swollen lymph nodes (\"swollen glands\"), headache, and less often fever, resembling symptoms of a viral infection.\\n  The redness resolves, without treatment, in about a month.</td>\n",

Lyme disease is most often transmitted by black-legged tick bites and in recent studies has also been found in mosquitos.  The Lyme literate medical team at Sponaugle Wellness Institute have also concluded it can be sexually transmitted or passed on to an unborn child.\\n  Black-legged ticks, also known as deer ticks, are most prevalent in the Northeast United States but have been found in all 50 states and Canada.  These ticks live in wooded and grassy areas.  Cases of Lyme disease are on the rise in recent years showing reported cases nearly doubling since 2014.  The CDC estimates cases in the United States at more than 300,000 people infected annually while acknowledging that Lyme disease can be difficult to diagnose.\\n  Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, is a corkscrew or helix-shaped organism called a spirochete.  These spirochetes are known for being serious pathogens with Lyme disease’s cellular make-up being close to that of syphilis.</td>\n",

If the Lyme disease is left untreated, Lyme patients may experience a wide range of physical and neurological symptoms including, loss of memory or concentration, depression, speech problems, pain and swelling, cough, facial palsy or muscle loss and more.\\n  Lyme disease can be broken down into 3 stages.\\n  Stage 1 (Detection)\\nOften called the “early localized” stage of lyme disease, symptoms start a few days to a few weeks after contraction.
