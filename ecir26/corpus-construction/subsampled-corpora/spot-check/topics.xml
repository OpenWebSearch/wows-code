  <description>The user wants to know about split ergonomic keyboards, descriptions on what they are and where you might buy them</description>

  <num>4</num><title>metoo Hollywood</title>
  <description>The metoo movement and aftermath, specifically in Hollywood.</description>
  <narrative>Relevant documents should contain information about how the metoo movement impacts Hollywood, could be a retrospective view, case study, opinion from an industry star etc. If the document does not mention Hollywood or filmmaking, it is not considered relevant. If the document is focused on Hollywood culture and only mentions metoo briefly, that too is not enough to make the document relevant.</narrative>

  <num>7</num><title>gastritis symptoms</title>
  <description>I want to know more about what symptoms are linked to gastritis</description>
  <narrative>Relevant documents would be documents that mention and list the symptoms patients with gastritis would have. Irrelevant documents are primarily documents that do not have any list of symptoms, so they could include a lot of information about gastritis, what could cause gastritis. But, if it never mentions the symptoms than it is not relevant.</narrative>
