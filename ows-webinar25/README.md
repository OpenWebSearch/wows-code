# Code for the OWS Webinar on Search Components: Development and Evaluation

This repository contains the code for the OWS webinar on ["Search Components: Development and Evaluation"](https://openwebsearch.eu/community/trainings-webinars/) that was held by Maik Fr√∂be on 3 February 2025.

The [slides](https://downloads.webis.de/talks/froebe2025a.pdf) are available as well as the [hands-on notebook](search-components-hands-on-notebook.ipynb).

## Description

Search engines use retrieval pipelines to create a list of search results shown to users. Those retrieval pipelines combine components that process queries (e.g., query expansion, performance prediction, etc.), documents (e.g., spam classification, document expansion/reduction, etc.), or query-document pairs (e.g., neural re-rankers)

## Recording

The webinar was recorded and the recording is [available online](https://openwebsearch.eu/community/trainings-webinars/).
